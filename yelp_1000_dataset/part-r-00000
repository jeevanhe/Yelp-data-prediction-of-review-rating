(we had the food in the middle of the table so that my family could share everything. plus, the strand of hair that i found was deep inside where i had to literally dig through the noodle.) now you are thinking i'm exaggerating, right? nope. the  lady owner came up to me, in quote, \"student, this hair can never be our hair. your hair must've fallen when you were eating.\" i was flabbergasted. she also told us that we still need to pay because we finished half of it. well, no shit, since the hair was inside the soup. \n\nnow, recently, i came here to eat lunch. i ordered kimchi soup with soft tofu inside and a fish. i didn't see any problem with that because i have ordered this 3 times in a row. the only reason i come here to eat is because of this menu until she ruined it for me. anyways, i called to put in the order because the service is pretty slow here. when i arrive, the waitress tells me we don't serve that anymore and that the owner would like to speak to me. so i sit down. the same owner comes to me and says, \"hello, so you ordered kimchijigaesoontofu(basically kimchi soup with soft tofu)? don't ever order it again since this is not on the menu. you don't have to come back here anymore. this will be the last time we serve this to you, okay? \" ladies, gentlemen, is this how a customer should be treated? the way she approached me was appalling. all restaurants should be accustomed of altering the food when a customer is allergic or would like to replace something with something. all i was asking for was kimchisoup with soft tofu inside. is that hard? as she told me, i will never return here. even right now i am very heated up about this circumstance. for an owner to tell a customer that to basically never return again just because the restaurant can't handle something so little is very disappointing. \n\nso as the owner told me, i will never ever return to this place.","restaurant_review::dat":"2014-07-05"}
